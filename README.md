Simple demos of LVGL v9 MicroPython apps that run on TulipCC https://github.com/shorepine/tulipcc

Figuring out how to use LVGL graphics with MicroPython is a challenge. All the Python example code was removed from the LVGL documentation with the release of Version 9.

I'm posting small apps that demonstrate using various LVGL widgets.

See also my MMT-8 simulator that is a more complete app. https://github.com/gmeader/tulip-mmt8
