Simple demos of LVGL v9 MicroPython apps that run on TulipCC https://github.com/shorepine/tulipcc

Figuring out how to use LVGL graphics with MicroPython is a challenge. All the Python example code was removed from the LVGL documentation with the release of Version 9, so these are a start creating working examples.

I'm posting small apps that demonstrate using various LVGL ver 9 widgets.
